    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      In the 2026 clinical landscape, “existence” is strictly defined by digital
      codification within the WHO’s ICD-11 and the APA’s DSM-5-TR. This paper
      presents a formal critique of the Exclusionary Diagnostic Framework applied
      to Unexplained Dermopathy (UD). By analyzing the “Classification Vacuum,”
      we demonstrate how the medical establishment utilizes a Diagnosis of
      Exclusion to bypass the rigorous materials science required to evaluate
      biogenic and synthetic anomalies in technology-saturated biological
      environments.

    <h3>1. The Ledger of Non-Existence: Codification as Reality</h3>

    <p>
      In contemporary medicine, the alpha-numeric code is the arbiter of truth.
      If a phenomenon does not possess a designated entry in the International
      Classification of Diseases (ICD), it is rendered invisible to the
      mechanisms of public health, insurance, and federal research funding.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The CDC Precedent (2012):</strong>
        By categorizing recovered materials as “consistent with” environmental
        debris, the CDC established a terminal evidentiary wall. This was not a
        proof of absence, but a cessation of inquiry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Administrative Masking:</strong>
        In the absence of a unique code, practitioners are forced to map
        MD/UD symptoms to L98.1 (Factitial Dermatitis). This creates a
        data-skewing feedback loop: the official record shows a rise in
        “self-mutilation” rather than the emergence of a novel material
        pathology.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>2. The Cognitive Pivot: DSM-5-TR and the Erasure of the Object</h3>

    <p>
      The APA’s classification of UD with MD-like presentations as Delusional
      Disorder, Somatic Type (F22) represents a fundamental shift in the burden
      of proof.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Subjectivity over Materiality:</strong>
        The diagnostic focus is redirected from the fiber (the object) to the
        observation and report of the fiber which is mislabeled as belief (the subject).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Sensory Disconnect:</strong>
        By labeling the tactile experiences as a hallucination and refusing to examen clinically,
        the system ignores other possible facros, such as piezoelectric properties and mechanical stressors
        of crystalline structures within the dermis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Result:</strong>
        The physical evidence is dismissed not because it is absent, but because
        the classification system has no bin for it other than “psychiatric.”
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>3. Materiality in Technology-Saturated Environments</h3>

    <p>
      The 2026 perspective must acknowledge that biological systems no longer
      exist in a vacuum. We reside in a materials-saturated environment where
      the boundaries between organic and synthetic are increasingly blurred.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Component Triad:</strong>
        The presence of cellulose, silica, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in
        human lesions mirrors the composition of contemporary conductive
        hydrogels and bio-scaffolds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Institutional Failure:</strong>
        The current diagnostic ledger (ICD/DSM) was built for nineteenth-century
        germ theory and twentieth-century psychiatry. It is fundamentally
        unequipped to classify bio-material interfaces or the spontaneous
        assembly of synthetic polymers in vivo.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>4. Conclusion: Facticity vs. Consensus</h3>

    <p>
      MD “does not exist” in the same way a book does not exist if it is removed
      from a library’s catalog. The “thin evidence” cited by skeptics is a
      manufactured byproduct of the refusal to count.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scientific community has mistaken a classification vacuum for a
      biological void. Until the taxonomy evolves beyond the binary of
      “pathogen” or “delusion,” Unexplained Dermopathy will remain a taxonomic
      ghost—real in the tissue, but absent from the ledger.
